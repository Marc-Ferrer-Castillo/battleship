# Battleship (Sink the fleet)
Classic game of sink the fleet in C ++

- Single-deck ships are placed on the 10x10 panel randomly (there are never ships adjacent to each other).
- 3 difficulty levels (each level has fewer attempts).
- Graphic mode (A 10x10 panel is shown on the screen that shows the shots and is refreshed with the cls command).
- The game ends once you sink all the fleet or once you complete all the attempts.
- (Runs in windows only, delete system("cls") on line 179 to run in other OS).
